### Smart-Irrigation-System
This project involves a homemade, fully solar powered, smart garden power grid and irrigation setup using solar power and IoT devices.

**Components used:**
1. Solar panel and charge control
2. DC water pump
3. Solenoid valves
4. [Shelly RGBW2](https://shelly.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ShellyRGBW2_userguide_EN_web.pdf)
5. Schnider Electric 12-entry junction box (for waterproof housing)
6. other common tools/materials

**Design:**
* Installed solar panels with a voltage stabilizer to power Shelly RGBW2.
* Solar Powered IoT device made by configuring powered up shelly to the wifi.
* 12V DC, 1/2" Solenoid valves used according to the irrigation hose needs.
* Next, we have the circuit setup with the pump, valves, shelly.
* Controlling the system is via the Shelly App and native integration with Google Home or Alexa

**Additional comments:**
This system can be made smarter with adding more features either directly through the app or through more devices (like sensors) to enable quick automation. Extending this project to a big greenhouse setup is feasible accounting to investment and commercial availability of additional devices.
