### Tesla Coils
In this project, with the tesla coils, we light a led (connected to a single wire) due to energy transfer to right from the left antenna.

**Components used:**
1. DDS Signal Generator
2. 2 metallic spheres of diameter 10cm
3. 2 x 10 meters of 0.5mmÂ² (20 AWG) electric wire
4. 2 wago type electrical connectors
5. patafix or chewing gum
6. 3D printed parts of coil and sphere support
7. Other common tools/materials

**Short guide:**
* Black flat coil made with five counterclockwise rotations and Red flat coils wrapped with thirty windings.
* Black wires clipped to first slot, Led to the second slot and red wires to wago connector along with pasting to the sphere.
* Two antennas connected with wago connector along with the BNC 3G wire.

**Working:**
* On the 2 antennas, energy is transferred by induction between black coil and red coil. Energy is transferred when the two antennas are in resonance.
* When the receiver goes into resonance, at the same time the left led turn on, and right led is off.
