### Advanced-Rocket-Flight-Computer
Here, I will document on a high-end model *rocket flight computer* for a rocket which can control itself without fins.

*Components used:*
1. Printed Circuit Boards ([downloadable here](https://hacksterio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachments/1108247/omega_v4_dev_iH8wTGMZul.png))
2. [Teensy 3.5](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Sparkfun%20PDFs/DEV-14055_Web.pdf)
3. [BMP388](https://www.mouser.com/pdfdocs/BST-BMP388-DS001-01.pdf)
4. [MPU6050](https://www.ti.com/product/DRV8320?HQS=ASC-MDBU-AMD-DRV8320-apc-ds-SFNet-in&DCM=yes&dclid=CILvnMqTlOkCFY9AnQkdp_UEQg)
5. 5050 SMD LED
6. Channel Mosfets

*Basic design:*
* It has 6 axis inertial measurement unit to measure orientation.
* Precise barometer to find the height of flight.
* three pyrotechnic channels to deploy parachutes and light second stage motor.
* communication with LED and buzzer.

*Setup:* PCB is ordered and parts are 3D printed, all soldered and assembled. Arduino IDE and Teensyduino downloaded and codes uploaded.

*Additional comments:* This model eliminates the use of fins in rockets as it can automatically maneuver itself and communicate accordingly. This project serves as a good example of Thrust Vector Control(TVC) and will help eliminate extra load and manual tasks in the control of the rocket.
