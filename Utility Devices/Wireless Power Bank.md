### Wireless Power Bank
In this project, we analyse a power bank with no switches. There are no charging ports on the power bank which charges itself as well as the external device wirelessely.

**Components used:**

**Short guide:** 
* We connect wireless charge receiver board to BMS boards and solder the LiPo in parallel to the output of BMS boards.(Now we can charge the batteries via the wireless charge receiver)
* Then we solder wireless charge transmitter with the batteries. (This will charge the mobiles)
* We install our powerbank wireless charging board in old charging plate and stick any 2Amp wireless charge transmitter coil on the upper part after soldering it to a micro USB. (This board is now used for charging our powerbank)
* Install the whole setup either in a 3D printed product or any random box.
That's it!!
