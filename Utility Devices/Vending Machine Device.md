### Vending Machine Device
This project involves to make a new feature for vending machines. It is basically a blank device that can connect vending machines and wifi/bluetooth.

**Components used:**
1. MDB/I2C
2. Optical inspection equipment
3. logic analyser
4. Arduino IDE
5. LTV-826 dual isolator
6. Regulators

**Design:**
* Power source through 34V to 5V regulator for MDB and non-conductive mineral oil used as a coolant.
* A laptop's processor or any arduino can work as the processor.
* The isolator chosen has a maximum rise/fall time of 18uS and a typical rise/fall time of 3 & 4 uS respectively
* Code designed and uploaded to the MDB device.
* Rest includes prototyping and lot's of learning!
