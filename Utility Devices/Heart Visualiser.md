### Heart Visualiser
This project involves a simple way to visually see your heartbeat using a Heart sensor.

**Components used:**
1. Arduino Nano
2. Servo SG90
3. MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter SpO2 and Heart-Rate Sensor Module
4. Micro USB Female jack (power input)
5. Perfboard
6. Male and female pin header connectors
7. other common tools/materials

**Short guide:**
* We 3D print many parts and add a suitable base. Servo is modified a bit for orientation.
* Circuit built with pulse sensors, arduino, servo, battery, etc.
* Code uploaded and parts assembled to form the product. That's it!!

**Additional Comments:** In this project, we can add features like counting heart rate, using AI to determine any disease possibility and other applications related to heart rate.
