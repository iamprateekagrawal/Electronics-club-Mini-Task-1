### Fidget Spinner Illusion
In this project, we make a fidget spinner to use 'Persistence of Vision' effect which is an optical illusion whereby multiple discrete images blend into a single image in the human mind irrespective of its roatation velocity.

**Design:**
* Microchip PIC 16F1619 microcontroller used as its core.
* The MCU has built-in Angular Timer peripheral which uses omnipolar Hall sensor DRV5033 and one magnet to keep the track of current rotational angle.
* The diodes are driven by two 16 channel constant current shift register drivers TLC59282 connected in daisy chain.
* Step down converter TPS62745 converts 6V to a stable 3.3V.
* Bluetooth Low Energy module RN4871 (accessible by a PC) communicates with the microcontroller via UART interface.
* Bluetooth helps to change the displaying text and its color and to monitor battery level.
* We take the font generated in "The Dot Factoryâ€œ as input and transform it to suit the needs of this project, through an application developed in LabVIEW.

**Additional comments:** This model is a good example to learn about interactions between various devices and their setup combination. This similar structure can again be exploited for other mechanisms like communication and to implement complex operations.
