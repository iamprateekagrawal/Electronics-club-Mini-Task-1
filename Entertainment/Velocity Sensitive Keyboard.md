### Velocity Sensitive Keyboard
This project involves a cardboard keyboard which sounds according to the velocity of press of keys. It basically uses proximity sensors for this task.

**Components used:**
1. Arduino
2. resistors
3. cable
4. reflective IR sensors
5. Universal pcb
6. other common tools/materials

**Short guide:**
* We start with making keyboard structure, installing cardboard pieces for base, keys, etc. and paint, add or write them as required.'
* Circuit constructed connecting keys and buzzers with the arduino using pcb.
* Programme code with respective inputs and outputs written and uploaded.

**Full Story** with circuit design and codes can be found [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/Velocity-Sensitive-Cardboard-Keyboard/)

**Additional comments:** This shows a relevant application of sensors with arduino and can be applied similarly to other models including entertainment/gaming devices and strength comparisons.
