### Test Reflex Game
This project is basically to test reflexes of a pair against each other. Simply, player has to choose the button matching the picture on the screen before the other does and the one with most points wins.

**Components used:**
1. A pc with access to Scratch.
2. Makey Makey kit.
3. conductive materials and other stationaries.

**Short Guide:**
* We simply make the input devices by pasting conductors next to the pictures used. 
* We make the code with variables - two for score of each player and one for the numbered pictures; with some waits and the code stops when any player reaches 10 points. 
* We wire the Makey Makey buttons.
And the project is ready!!
